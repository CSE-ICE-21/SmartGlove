# SmartGlove Project

## Project Overview
The **SmartGlove** is an innovative wearable device designed to recognize hand gestures and convert them into audio commands, as well as control smart home automation systems. This project aims to develop a responsive, user-friendly solution that empowers individuals with speech impairments to communicate through hand gestures while also providing intuitive gesture-based control over connected smart devices. Using advanced flex sensors and a powerful microcontroller, the SmartGlove captures precise finger movements and translates them into specific audio outputs and control signals for home automation. The development process will be documented, from initial design and prototyping to final implementation, providing a detailed overview of each stage.
